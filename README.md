# Part numbering system
This may seem useless now, but once things start getting big it will be useful

The LUID is a 7 digit number: XXX-XXXX
1. Subteam (1=Software, 2=Electrical, 3=Mechanical)
2-3. Project (This is a higher level project within a subteam i.e. digger, camera )
4-5. Component (This is the part of the project i.e. digger blade )
6-7. Version (This is the version number)

Some good part naming conventions:
0. Software- make the interface code component 0
1. Electrical- make the high-level diagram component 0
2. Mechanical- make the master sketch component 0
